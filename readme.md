previously known as the End User Computing (EUC) Digital Workspace "EucDigitalWorkspace"


This repository has the files the organization displays when someone views the GitHub page for the organization.

To change what is displayed there, alter profile/readme.md

The repository name `.github` is a special name recognised by GitHub. 
So is the directory name `profile`. See the documentation here.
